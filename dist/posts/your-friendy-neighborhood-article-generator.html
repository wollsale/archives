        <h1>NewsGen:  Your friendly neighborhood article generator</h1>

<p>NewsGen provides tooling to pull corpuses of articles in order to generate new
articles utlizing parts of speech tagging and markov chain natural language
generation techniques.</p>

<h2>Generation techniques</h2>

<p>At the core, NewsGen, uses the excellent NLTK project to parse sentences and identify parts of
speech.  Markovify is used to generate sentences, but we add a few twists.</p>

<p>Markov chains by default are pretty effective at creating reasonable sounding
gobbledygook, but are ineffective at creating a reasonably coherent connection
between junk sentences.  If that is a thing at all.</p>

<p>In order to do slightly better, we do two things:</p>

<p>1) Provide a mechanism to cull the corpus based on keywords to so that we have
a more coherent starting set of data.</p>

<p>2) Generate a lot of candidate sentences and use Levenshtein distance to
attempt to pick the most coherent candidate sentence for our generated
articles.</p>

$ python3 ./newsgen.py -h
